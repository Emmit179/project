One-Sentence Overview
We provide an adversarial AI platform that stress-tests corporate communications for hidden brand risks, helping legal and PR teams prevent public relations disasters before they happen.

The MVP (First Paying Customers & Seed Funding)
The MVP is a minimalist web application designed to prove that high-value corporate teams will pay for a specialized, "adversarial" AI analysis. It is built for a specific user—a senior member of a corporate communications, PR, or in-house legal team—who is responsible for approving high-stakes external text like press releases, CEO statements, or marketing campaigns. The application allows an authenticated user to paste a block of text into a simple input field and run a "Risk Analysis," which uses a fine-tuned LLM to perform one core job: identify and flag specific phrases that could be maliciously misinterpreted, taken out of context, or create unintended legal or brand liabilities. The output is not a grammar check, but a concise, actionable report of potential "attack vectors" a journalist, competitor, or angry mob on social media might exploit, allowing the team to neutralize the risk before publishing.

The Broader Vision (Path to a $30M Exit)
Our vision is to become the indispensable risk-auditing layer for all enterprise communication, establishing a new category of "Communications Security" (CommSec).

Phase 2: The Proactive Workflow Integration (Years 1-3): We will evolve from a reactive, copy-paste tool into a proactive platform that integrates directly into the enterprise workflow. We'll build plugins for Google Docs, Microsoft Word, and Slack, automatically flagging risky language as it's being written. By analyzing the conversational context within a team, the AI will provide real-time warnings and suggestions, making risk mitigation a seamless, collaborative part of the content creation process. This moves us from a helpful utility to an essential piece of infrastructure, dramatically increasing stickiness and user engagement.

Phase 3: The Enterprise Command Center (Years 3-5): We will expand our analysis beyond text to audit all forms of public-facing content, including images, ad creatives, and social media schedules. The platform will become a centralized dashboard for the Chief Communications Officer (CCO) and General Counsel, providing a holistic view of the company's "brand risk surface area." It will use predictive analytics to model the potential fallout of different messaging strategies and run pre-launch "war game" simulations against our adversarial AI, enabling data-driven decision-making for major brand initiatives.

Phase 4: The Exit (Years 5-7): By becoming the system of record for pre-publication risk assessment, we will be a highly attractive acquisition target. Potential acquirers include:

Major Cloud/Productivity Players (Microsoft, Google): To integrate our CommSec layer directly into Microsoft 365 or Google Workspace as a premium enterprise security feature.

PR & Communications Giants (Cision, Meltwater): To add a unique, high-margin, AI-powered service to their existing suite of media monitoring and distribution tools.

LegalTech & GRC Platforms (Relativity, OneTrust): To expand their governance, risk, and compliance offerings into the critical and underserved area of communications and brand reputation.
